title: Delivery
teaser: "

There are two ways we can help with delivery. We can provide expertise in key areas to augment an existing team. Our consultants are highly skilled and experienced agile professionals, who lead teams by example and can mentor fellow team members in modern practises.
<br/><br/>
Alternatively we can take complete ownership of the delivery process and provide a fixed price based on the desired outcome â€“ typically high level business goals.  Agile practises will be used for delivery to ensure transparency, quick feedback and business value [1].
