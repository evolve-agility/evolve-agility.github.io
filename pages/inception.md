teaser: "This tightly-structured collaborative workshop of between 2-10 days guides the delivery team and key stakeholders through an intensive and efficient analysis. Based on this framing, it will be evident whether the project should proceed and how best to begin. Moreover, the team is on the same page to begin delivering value immediately."

## Why?

Getting an agile inception right is the best way to set up a project for success. It helps everyone to understand *why* we are here. This is core to framing the *what* and *when* parts of the project as well.

They're more bang for your buck than any other way of starting a project. Just as agile software development encourages continuous improvement, they get better every time they're run, and as a result, not only are they useful and interesting; they're fun!

## When is it Appropriate?

* To prepare prospective team members, product owners and sponsor to fully contribute to an imminent agile delivery project.
* To comprehensively evaluate the feasibility of proceeding with a project that is of uncertain cost-benefit.

## Benefits

A comprehensive assessment of the feasibility of a complex project undertaking.

The delivery team quickly gains a common understanding of the complex inter-relationships among project objectives, opportunities, risks and approach.

A solid foundation for project success as the team are socialised, energised, and committed to delivery in a high-performance collaborative team.

Superior projection of delivery timeframes.
